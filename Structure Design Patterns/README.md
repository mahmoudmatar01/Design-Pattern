# Structural Design Patterns

This repository contains an implementation of various structural design patterns in [programming language of your choice]. Structural design patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures, and they are focused on simplifying the design by identifying simple ways to realize relationships between objects.

## Structural Design Patterns Overview

Structural design patterns provide solutions for creating relationships between objects to form larger structures. These patterns help in defining clear interfaces between classes and objects and can make a system more flexible and efficient. Some common structural patterns include:

- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.

- **Decorator Pattern**: Attaches additional responsibilities to objects dynamically.

- **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

- **Flyweight Pattern**: Minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects.

- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
